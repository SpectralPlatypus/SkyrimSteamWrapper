## SkyrimSteamWrapper

A proxy dll that allows running earlier CK versions in conjunction with the latest Skyrim update (1.6.1130)

Based on code from [skse64_plugin_preloader](https://github.com/aers/skse64_plugin_preloader)

## Instructions
- Create a folder named "proxy" in the same directory as the Skyrim executable
- Move the existing "steam_api64.dll" to this new directory
- Copy over "steam_api64.dll" from this project to where the old dll used to be

Tested with CK 1.5.73.0 and Skyrim SE 1.6.1130
